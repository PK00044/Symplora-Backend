# Employee Leave Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Leave Management System** built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **FastAPI** for the backend. It enables employees to apply for leaves, view their leave balance, and allows managers to approve or reject leave applications.

## Deployment Links

* **Backend (FastAPI + SQLite)** ‚Üí [Render Deployment](https://symplora-backend-i3d1.onrender.com/docs)
* **Frontend (React + Vite)** ‚Üí [Vercel Deployment](https://symplora-backend-m1irn6mel-pratham-kubsads-projects.vercel.app/)

## Features Implemented ‚úÖ

* Add new employees
* List all employees
* Apply for leaves (with warnings if balance is low)
* View leave balance per employee
* List all leave applications
* Approve/Reject leave requests

## Future Enhancements üöÄ

* **Authentication & Roles** ‚Üí Secure login for employees and managers
* **Email Notifications** ‚Üí Notify employees/managers on leave updates
* **Analytics Dashboard** ‚Üí Track leave trends and employee availability
* **Scalable Database** ‚Üí Currently uses **SQLite** for MVP, but can be migrated to **PostgreSQL** for production scalability
* **CI/CD Pipeline** ‚Üí Automated testing and deployments

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Frontend** ‚Üí React + Vite + Fetch API
* **Backend** ‚Üí FastAPI (Python)
* **Database** ‚Üí SQLite (for MVP)
* **Hosting** ‚Üí Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)

This project demonstrates a **scalable MVP** approach where SQLite was chosen for simplicity in the prototype phase, with clear pathways to migrate to PostgreSQL and add advanced features.
